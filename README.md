# **Facial Expression Recognition**  
**A PyTorch-based project to classify human facial expressions from images.**  

## **Overview**  
This project uses **PyTorch** to build and train a machine learning model for **facial expression recognition**. The goal is to classify human facial expressions into categories such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc., using images from the **ExpW** and **CelebA** datasets.  

While the model does not achieve high accuracy, this project is a is a great way to start learning about **computer vision**, including **data preprocessing**, **model training**, and **evaluation** in PyTorch.

## **Datasets**  
The project uses two datasets:  
1. **ExpW (Expression in-the-Wild):**  
   - Contains over 90,000 images labeled with 7 basic emotions.  
   - [ExpW Dataset](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/expw)  

2. **CelebA (CelebFaces Attributes Dataset):**  
   - Contains over 200,000 celebrity images with 40 attribute annotations, including facial expressions.  
   - [CelebA Dataset](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/celeba)
